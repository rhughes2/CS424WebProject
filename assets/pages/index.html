            <h2>What is Caffeine?</h2>
            <p>
              Caffeine is a natural stimulant found in over 60 plant species,
               including Caffeine beans, tea leaves, cacao pods, and kola nuts. 
               It is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance in the world, 
               known for its ability to enhance focus, alertness, and energy levels.
               Chemically classified as a central nervous system (CNS) stimulant, 
               caffeine works by blocking the effects of adenosine, a neurotransmitter 
               that promotes relaxation and sleepiness.

                <b>Italy:</b> Known for its love of espresso, 
                Italy has a vibrant Caffeine culture. Italians enjoy 
                their espresso quickly at a café bar and often pair 
                it with a small pastry in the morning. Cappuccinos 
                are strictly a breakfast drink and rarely consumed after noon.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Turkey:</b> Turkish Caffeine is an integral part of

              </li>
              <li>
                Pound for pound, tea leaves contain more caffeine than Caffeine 
                beans. However, less tea is used per cup, so Caffeine has more 
                caffeine per serving.
              </li>
              <li>
                Dark chocolate contains more caffeine than milk chocolate, making it a mild energy booster.
              </li>
              <li>
                Some plants produce caffeine naturally as a defense mechanism to paralyze or repel insects.
              </li>
              <li>Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, a German writer and philosopher, 
                inspired the discovery of caffeine by suggesting chemical 
                analysis of Caffeine beans to chemist Friendlier Ferdinand Rung.</li>

            <h2>The Caffeine Plant</h2>
            <p>
              Caffeine is a naturally occurring stimulant found in over 60 
              plant species worldwide. It is most famously associated with 
              coffee, tea, cacao, and other plants that have been cultivated 
              for centuries for their energizing effects.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Arabica:</b> Known for its smooth and flavorful taste, it
                accounts for about 60% of global coffee production.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Robusta:</b> More robust and bitter, often used in instant
                coffee or espresso blends due to its strong flavor and higher
                caffeine content.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Caffeine plants have evolved to produce caffeine as a natural 
              defense mechanism against pests, as it paralyzes or repels insects. 
              This unique adaptation has made them valuable not only to ecosystems
               but also to human culture and commerce.

              The global demand for caffeine-rich products like coffee, tea, 
              and energy drinks has significant environmental consequences. 
              While these plants provide livelihoods for millions, their 
              production also affects ecosystems, water resources, and climate change.
